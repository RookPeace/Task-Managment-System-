Thoroughly test each feature and scenario to identify and fix any bugs.
Perform usability testing to ensure a smooth user experience.

12.Documentation:
Write clear and comprehensive documentation for installation, setup, and usage.
Document the app's features, endpoints, and any third-party integrations.

13.Deployment and Hosting:
Deploy your front-end and back-end to appropriate hosting platforms (e.g., Heroku, Netlify, Vercel).
Set up databases and ensure data persistence.

14.Readme and Project Documentation:
Create a detailed README.md file that includes project information, installation steps, and usage instructions.
Address any known issues, limitations, or future enhancements.

15.User Testing and Feedback:
Invite friends or colleagues to test the application and provide feedback.
Make necessary improvements based on user feedback.

16.Final Testing and Polish:
